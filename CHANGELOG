# Changelog BlueBird

## v0.3.4

- add status code to documented response

## v0.3.3

- fix `doc_path` and `ignore_headers` config not working

## v0.3.2

- add pipeline configuration
- return `conn` from `ConnLogger.save/1` to allow piping in tests

## v0.3.1

- group actions by resource to avoid aglio warnings

## v0.3.0

This release is a complete rewrite of the library.

### Breaking Changes

- The parameter field of the `api/3` macro now requires a keyword list as the
  third parameter.
- The `group` and `resource` fields of the `api/3` macro have been removed.
- The group now depends on the controller.

### Non-breaking changes

- No more subsections under groups. Only two levels of headers (group and
  action).

### New features

- Added `apigroup` macro to define the group name and description per controller
  (the description isn't rendered yet).
- Added configuration option to ignore certain headers.
- Query parameters are now being collected from the requests and added to the
  documentation. Note that they will only be rendered by aglio if they are
  present in the `api/3` definition.
